# About The Project 
**PI System Log Analyzer** is designed to analyze a large dataset of user login records, which aims to identify inactive users from PI System, and report the result to a formatted .CSV file. The process involves reading, processing, and querying data from both an extracted CSV file from PI Data Archive with command-line utility .\pigetmsg and Active Directory to retrieve an employees' [displayName], [email], [manager] through LDAP IP Protocol. The purpose of the project is to ensure the security and keep the PI System environment clean.
